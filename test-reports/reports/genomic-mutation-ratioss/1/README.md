# Kyso Comments

User 1: This is really interesting, and could be very useful for our team. Would it be possible to format this as a template that anyone could just clone, upload their data an run the notebook?
    Author: For sure, I'll re-format the report later this week and it should be good to go for you.


User 2: We need to create a channel or tag on Kyso specifically for Plotly tutorials; lots of people around the org could benefit from the added interactivity.
    Author: Great idea!!
